## Available Scripts

Open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
